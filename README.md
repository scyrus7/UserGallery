    I connected the App to Stackoverflow Users API Endpoint and retrieve the first page of data. 
	The following functionalities has been implemented so far:
	
    Display the retrieved data through a TableLayout.
    We expect from you to display at least username, badges and gravatar for every user.
    While the gravatar is being downloaded, the UI should show a loading animation.
    The UI should always be responsive.
